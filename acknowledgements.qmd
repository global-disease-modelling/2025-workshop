### Acknowledgement of country

The Kids Research Institute Australia acknowledges Aboriginal people as the Traditional Owners of the land and seas of Australia. We also acknowledge the Noongar Nation and especially the Whadjuk people as the custodians of the land on which the Institute is located.

We pay our respects to Elders past, present, and future and seek their wisdom in our work to improve the health of all children.
