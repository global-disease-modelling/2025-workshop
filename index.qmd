This is the website for the Global Disease Modelling team's intensive workshop, held 13-15 January 2025 at The Kids Research Institute Australia.

Participating in the workshop means you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.qmd).

### Overview

By the end of this workshop, you should be comfortable with:

-   Using Git on the command line
-   Using bash to navigate your computer
-   Understanding how to submit jobs to a supercomputer

The workshop will be run in a flipped classroom mode, which means you will be working on live problem-solving during the workshop sessions and do your own research outside of the sessions.
